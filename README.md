# Lab 1 - Well Equipped
# By: Chrissy Witt
# Summary
The goal of this lab was to introduce us to the lab equipment, help familiarize us with github, and make sure we remember how to take measurements given different instruments such as a Digital Multimeter, O-Scope, Function Generator, and a Direct Current Power Supply. 
# Materials
Cables
Capacitors
Resistors
#Assembly Procedures
1. We measured four different resistors using two different Digital Multimeters, while also looking at a color chart and writing down the expected resistance and tolerance. We then compared the data. 
2. We next repeated the same process for four capacitors, measuring their capacitance with a Digital Multimeter and a dedicated capacitance meter. 
3. We then used our D.C. Power Supply, adjusting the voltage to several different values and measuring them with the D.M.M. Afterwards, we compared the measured values to the values on the power supply.
4. Lastly, we measured a sin wave by connecting the function generator. We used several different methods of measuring the amplitude and frequency of the wave.
# Test Equipment
Oscilloscope
Digital Multimeter
Function Generator
Direct Current Power Supply
#Test Procedures
1. For step 1, we tested the resistors using two different D.M.M.'s, a generic and a Fluke, connecting them to both ends of the resistor. 
2. For step 2, we measured the capacitors using a D.M.M. and a dedicated capacitance meter. 
3. In step 3, we measured the voltage by using a D.M.M.
4. In step 4, we tested the amplitude and frequency of a sin wave using the following methods:
a. Counting squares
b. Cursors on the O-Scope
c. Measurement features on O-Scope
d. Generic D.M.M.
e. Fluke D.M.M.

# Discussion
All of the measured values were within range of our expectations and stayed within the tolerance.
